# Downmix-Injector
Downmix Injector converts multichannel audio in video files into stereo AAC and injects it into new MKVs without re-encoding video. It scans folders, lists files missing stereo for selective batch processing, shows per-file and overall progress with ETA, and supports threaded ffmpeg and mkvmerge
